# PaleoO2_RootSoil
PaleoOxygen_RootSoil model: The model MATLAB(R) script calculates landplant root depth associated with atmospheric pO2 required by (fossil) trees in non-wetland areas.  The model also calculates the drawdown of O2 in the soil by plant root and microbial respiration, for a chosen soil type in which these fossil trees grew.
